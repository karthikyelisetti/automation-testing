/**
 * Return Type of a method
 * 
 * 1. Every method will have a "return" statement to the end of a method.
 * 
 * between return and a semicolon (;) if no data is available then it is called
 * as default return statement.
 * 
 * If compiler auto generated the statement, if the developers forgets to
 * mention the statement then also it is known as default return statement.
 * 
 * If there is a value available in between return statement and a semicolon(;)
 * then based on the data type of the value, the return statement of the method
 * will change.
 * 
 * return statement always remains the last statement in the method
